China is home to a wide range of monkeys and other primates, but with the wild ones largely in remote or mountainous areas, zoos offer the best chance for many Chinese to see some up close in this Chinese Year of the Monkey. In anticipation of especially large crowds in coming days, the Nanjing Hongshang Forest Zoo, in the eastern province of Jiangsu, is celebrating the start of the Lunar New Year on Monday with a week of educational events about their primates, some of which are endangered and under special protection. Several of the animals are being shown to the public for the first time.

Two zookeepers, Zhang Hui and Bu Haixia, discussed in interviews their charges, what is different about the Year of the Monkey and whether monkeys care.

Zhang Hui, handler of three golden snub-nosed monkeys, native to central and southwest China:

Q. Tell us about the monkeys.

A. We have Wei Wei, a 3-year-old male, and Si Si and Lao Dou, both female. I don’t have the ages of the females, but they’re both adults. Wei Wei and Si Si were just transferred here from a nursery facility of the zoo to join Lao Dou, so she’d have some company, but also to celebrate the Year of the Monkey.

Q. So the coming Lunar New Year is going to be special?

A. They have no idea what that means.

The best treat I hope they’ll get for the year that’s being celebrated in their name is that they’ll get to live in a more enriched environment, where they can display their natural behavior and not be tempted by the food visitors throw at them.

Visitors do still throw food, and part of my job is to educate them on why that’s bad.

Q. How are the three of them getting along?

A. Wei Wei established his status as the alpha male on Day 1. Golden monkeys live in patriarchal, family-based groups where a dominant male keeps a harem of three to five females. And that’s what we’re seeing with this group.

Lao Dou is assuming a subordinate position now. She grooms Wei Wei and never eats until he’s finished eating. Wei Wei has also started having intercourse with her. They have intercourse quite frequently.

Q. The zoo is holding educational events for the New Year holiday week starting on Monday. Are you going to host a lot of tours?

A. Yes. Golden snub-nosed monkeys are among our most popular primates. I’ve heard visitors marvel at their shiny fur. They’re also very endangered and almost as rare as pandas, but they’re not getting as much attention.

Bu Haixia, handler for two hoolock gibbons, found in southwest China and Tibet:

Q. What’s a typical day like with the gibbons?

A. My day starts at 7:40 a.m., with me cleaning the cages and checking in on Duo Duo [a male] and Guo Guo [a female] to see if everything is normal. They’re familiar enough with me now to let me touch them.

My colleagues and I feed them four times a day, beginning with leaves of glossy privet in the early morning, followed by some vegetables and then some fruit. They have to eat their vegetables before they get the fruit, which is a lot tastier. In the afternoon, there’s one last meal of vegetables and fruit.

Q. Are they getting any special treats for the Year of the Monkey?

A. Not really. Although we do gift-wrap food and hide it for them to forage on special occasions like New Year’s. Even on a regular day, food isn’t just shoved into the cage in a bowl. We have them work to find their food as a way to maintain their foraging behavior.

Q. They’re new arrivals?

A. We got them when they were a year old. Now they’re both five. They’ve spent the past four years in the zoo, but this week is the first time they’ve been shown to visitors. You know, because of the Year of the Monkey.

Q. How are they handling the people around them?

A. Gibbons are territorial and can get aggressive when they think you’re in their zone. That’s the way Duo Duo and Guo Guo acted after being transferred to their current cage. They held up tight in their corners and made calls that sounded a lot like a dog barking.

I’ve been able to establish trust with them. Now we can get pretty close, though always with a fence between us.
